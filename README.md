# Quantum Trading: Using IBM Q to Predict Price Movements

A sophisticated Python project that harnesses the power of quantum computing (IBM Q) combined with MetaTrader 5 for financial market analysis and price movement prediction. This implementation merges traditional algorithmic trading strategies with quantum computing capabilities to analyze market trends and forecast future price directions.

## Overview

The project utilizes quantum computing algorithms to analyze market states and predict price movements through the following key processes:

- Real-time market data retrieval from MetaTrader 5
- Conversion of price movements into quantum-compatible binary sequences
- Quantum state analysis using IBM Q quantum computers
- Market prediction verification against historical data
- Advanced quantum noise filtering and error correction

## Key Features

The system provides comprehensive functionality for quantum-based trading analysis:

```python
async def quantum_trading_system():
    """Main trading system loop"""
    while True:
        try:
            market_data = await get_market_data()
            quantum_result = await run_quantum_analysis(market_data)
            filtered_result = filter_quantum_noise(quantum_result)
            
            if check_trading_conditions(filtered_result):
                await execute_trades(filtered_result)
                
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"System error: {str(e)}")
